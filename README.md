# password_manager_GUI

This project was for expanding my knowledge and growth in Python and developing GUIs. The tool I am using for the GUI is TKinter. There are other imports listed at the top of the main.py file.

Concepts practicing:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Tkinter GUI Development
- Random Password Generation
- Tkinter grid layout management

This is a simple password manager GUI application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their passwords locally for personal use.

## Features
- Add new passwords with associated website and username.
- All passwords stored are in a table format in a txt file (again for personal and local use only).
- Generate random passwords if user does not want to create their own.
- Requires username and password to be entered before adding a new password. There will be pop-window that will appear if the user does not enter a username or password. Along with to confirm if you want to add the new password.
